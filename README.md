# WDI PROJECT 1
This is my first project from my web development immersive course at General Assembly

I created a musical memory game using Javascript, CSS and HTML called **Play That Tune!** where the user has to repeat the same sequence played by the computer. If they're correct then the computer plays another sequence of a longer duration. But one wrong move and the player goes back to the first stage.

The keys light up and play sound and the user follows suit by clicking on the keys.

**What went well**

* I'm now a lot more comfortable using functions
* I think the styling, though simplistic, works well and I am happy with it.

**What was a challenge**

* Despite being happy with the styling, I actually found it to be a challenge - Getting the elements  to align nicely and choosing a complimentary colour scheme.
* Knowing how to write the code to implement certain actions within the game.


Going forward, if I were to redo/rework this project then I would get rid of the alert box and just have alerts about the player status appear on the page itself. I would also add levels so the player knows how far they've progressed.
